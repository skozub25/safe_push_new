safe push new


## TODO IDEAS

- We need to answer the question, How is this different that other scanners that exist? E.g. github has their own secret scanner when you push
- UI??
- Canary token experiment (stretch)


## NOTES
- If we flag something for known provider pattern, then we won't flag it for anything else as well

- labeled corpus has been started , tests/corpus, we test for entropy and pattern cases (needs more work)

- canary tokens working / dedupe done
